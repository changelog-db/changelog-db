    ChangelogDB makes it less painful to read changelogs before upgrading your
    JavaScript dependencies. <a

      rel="noreferrer noopener"
      target="_blank">A manually curated package â†’ changelog URL mapping</a

    is provided to hopefully make it more reliable than heuristics-based solutions.

  <h2>Prior art and comparison</h2>
  <ul>
    {#each priorArt as { name, desc }}
      <li>
        <a
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer noopener"
          class="font-bold"
          href="https://npmjs.com/package/{name}">npm:{name}</a
        >
        <p>{desc}</p>
      </li>
    {/each}
  </ul>
  <p>
    ChangelogDB provides a browser interface for looking up changelogs. As
    changelogs are generally written for humans (not well-structured), and to be
    read in the browser or an editor, providing a centralized viewer is a futile
    effort.
