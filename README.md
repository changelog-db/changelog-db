# changelog-db

Last updated: 2023-05-02T09:56:52+0900

A manual best-effort attempt at creating a third-party npm package name â†’ changelog URL mapping.

Scope:

- other software registries
  - [pypi](https://pypi.org/): already records it

Monorepo GitHub releases: If I can find a search term to narrow it down to the package, I'll try to do so. If not, the release page is recorded as the changelog URL instead. Example of the latter would be Astro.

GitHub path links: [use `-` to refer to *the default branch*](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64726262/is-there-a-stable-url-to-always-get-the-default-branch-in-github).
